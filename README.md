# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Our goal was compare the three differnet types of citys (urban, suburban, rural) and see what thier weekly fares were for each respective type for the time frame of January 1st to April 28th.

### Urban Data
The Urban area has by far the most fares per week, and can account for alot of revanue. We advise focusing more resources on this market. Their are more then 1 driver for every ride, which allows for the fares per ride to be less since we have more people willing to drive. This allows helps us keep a competitive edge on our competitors. We would like to look into the data of how long or how big of a distance the average car drives for us, since that may be another factor into why the urban areas avearge fares are less then the rural areas.

### Suburban
The Suburban area most likely has alot of room for growth. We almost have a 1:1 ratio of drivers to rides and if we get more drivers it will natuarally decrease the price of rides for suburban areas due to supply and demand. One thing to look into is the reason for people taking rides. The suburban household sterotypically has a car and is able to get where they want by themselves. However if we know a majority of susburban areas use our rides for getting to the airport, or to sports games then we can market our product much better. We might want to start tracking where the drivers are going and get an analysis of the final destinations. This can help us expand into the suburban market.

### Rural
The Rural area is not profitable for us, and if we are focusing any resources to that market then they should be allocated elsewhere. Looking at the total drivers in each city, we can see that the Rural city has only 78 drivers which make the average fare per ride larger for the rural areas as seen below. The low supply of drivers is making the average fare larger in rural areas. Unless we are willing to make less profits in those areas by either cutting our prices for rides or by paying drivers more per ride to insentivize more drivers in rural areas, it would be extremly hard to penitrate this market

## Summary
After looking into the three city types we have come to three conclusions
1. When looking at the Urban Data in relation to the other city types, we can see that for the months of Janauray to April Urban coninually outperformed the other typed by a staggering amount. At most given times, Urban would outperform the Suburban city by almost 100%. We can take away that the Urban city type market for us is bringing in the most money consistantly. We would just need to see the costs/drivers for the urban city to see how profitable it is. We should look into strengthening this market.
 
2. The Suburban line is by far more stable then the Urban line, which we would need to do a deeper analysis of why the fares are around the $1,000 mark most of the time. It could be due to a multitude of factors, from consitant drivers, to a conistant user base with little growth. The Suburban line needs to be analysised deeper so that we can see he fesability of expanding this market, but we beleive it has much room to grow due to it having relativly high number of rides compared to rural. This should be 2nd or 1st priroty depending on if you want to strengthen the Urban market, or go deeper into the Suburban market. 
 
3. Rural by far has the least amount of Fares per week. This is most likely due to rural areas sterotypecally having less people, more spread out areas, and most everyone having thier own vehicals to get where they need to go. It would be hard to penitrate this market as the Rural areas tend to be less technilogially savy as Urban and Suburban areas. with such low fares per week, it would be advised to do limited marketing in this area to cut down on costs and try to focus resources on the other two city types.
